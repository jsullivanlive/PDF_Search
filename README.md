# PDF_Search

This is a programming test used to ascertain whether an applicant has basic web development skills when they do not yet have an open source portfolio.  This project should take less than 4 hours to complete.  The goal is to get to know you through your source code which is how we hired all other developers on the team.  We strive to have a balance between function and form:

- form:  twitter bootstrap or something comparable theme is just fine with us
- function:  it should be intuitive to use, it's a relatively simple task after all

### Customer Requirements

We have a vision for a free utility website to allow people to search a pdf with a string and get the page numbers where the string occurs.  The target demographic is people with pdf viewers that do not have a text search function.

The website should allow users to upload a pdf document, provide a search string, and get a list of page numbers where the string exists.  This way they can open their document and easily seek to the term they wanted to find.

We are not sure yet how we will make money with it, but once it goes viral we can figure it out!  ;)

### Assignment Requirements

1. Fork this repo so you can work on it
2. Deploy to heroku or another service for us to test it
2. Send us the deployment url and your forked repo url so we can check them out

Example pdfs provided in the folder `example_pdfs`
